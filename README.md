This is a project I started to try and make a website that can introduce any person to the catholic world. My objective as I write this, the day I came with the idea, is to make it so that the website works from the ground up, first introducing basic concepts like our world around us, why we exist, why there must exist a God, the concept of God, and so on until we reach the truth of the Catholic faith. This I do, so I can reference any curious minds to this website and here they could find the essential answers.

Is this different from Catholic Answers?
In essence it should. As the objective of the project is for it to be a roadmap for any non-believer to follow. As of now I still don't know if it will be like an objective-like interface where you unlock each thing step by step or just a collection of ordered data in the manner that I specified before. Catholic Answers is more oriented into a Q&A rather than a roadmap for non-believers.

When will this be finished?
I don't know. I'm starting this out of the pure urge of having something to do, I am currently studying CS, but have not actually made anything useful, which has made me question if I really want to study this. I am passionate about my faith though, becoming a priest has even crossed my mind, but I'm not there yet. So this is a side project that I want to work in to mix my studies with my passion, our faith.

Can I colaborate?
Sure you can, that's why it is a public repository.

Extra notes
I'm still a learner, I have previous experience making websites, but nothing too big or useful. I might start weak, but hope to get better overtime. If anyone comes across this repository any help or ideas would be greatly appreciate it. God bles you all!
