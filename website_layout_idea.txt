Here I lay out the different webpages that I intend to add to the project, each one has a structure of what I want to include.
They will be added in an ordered manner, as in the order they will appear when scrolled, top to bottom.

SYNTAX USED FOR WRITING:
> webpage name
    >> sections of a webpage
        >>> elements of a section
            (comments by me)
            unsure of addition?
    

START

> Homepage
    >> Navigation Bar
        >>> Links to other webpages such as "Road Map", "Q&A", "Discussions", "Contact" (These webpages may not be final)
        >>> Language selection (Guaranteed to add: English, Spanish, Korean and Japanese, as I know these)
    >> Greeting Screen
        >>> Title with something engaging
        >>> Brief description of the objective
        >>> Button to start right away (maybe link to Road Map)
        >>> Background Image?
    >> Personal Inquiries
        >>> Multiple questions that could be asked to a catholic such as "Is there a God?", "Why Catholicism and not Protestantism?", "Why do I exist?", etc.
            (This part is meant to be like a collection of possible quesitons the reader might have, questions that the website will answer systematically)
    >> Discovery Method
        >>> Brief description of the method that will be used (From the ground up, first believe that there is a God, then that Christianity is True, then that Catholicism is true)
        >>> Intuitive picture with it?
> Road Map
> Q&A
> Contact

END

*THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, I WILL FILL IT AS I COME UP WITH IDEAS
